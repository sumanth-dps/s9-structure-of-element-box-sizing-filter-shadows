        explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his
        actors, but can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the
        director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes
        out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and
        logical reason to make a GenZ lad to hold back his feelings for his lover
        until the last moment. However, he compensates it all, by adding loads of
        fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some
        touching moments."[27] In 2011, he appeared in another romantic comedy Mr.
        Perfect. The review site GreatAndhra rated the film with three stars and
        noted "The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the
        intention of the makers must be appreciated.[28] His performance in the
        film earned him his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best
        Actor – Telugu.
